**Python Program Summary**:

The Python program is a data logger for an Allen-Bradley PLC using the `pycomm3` library. It continuously monitors a specified PLC tag, and when the tag value changes, it fetches data from other tags and saves the data in separate CSV files, with a new file created at the end of each day. The program reads its configuration from a `config.txt` file, which contains information about the PLC's IP address, the tag to watch, the tags to fetch data from, and the sleep interval between checks.

The program starts by importing necessary libraries, defining functions to read data from the PLC, create CSV files, and read the configuration from the `config.txt` file. The main function sets up logging to log messages into a separate log file, `my_log_file.log`.

Once the program starts, it enters a loop to continuously monitor the specified PLC tag. If the tag value changes, the program fetches data from the other tags and saves it to a new CSV file in a folder named with the current date.

**config.txt File Summary**:

The `config.txt` file contains the configuration for the Python program. It is a simple text file with the following parameters:

- `IP`: The IP address of the Allen-Bradley PLC.
- `TagToWatch`: The name of the PLC tag to monitor for changes.
- `Tags`: A comma-separated list of tags from which data should be fetched when `TagToWatch` changes.
- `sleepTime`: The interval in seconds between each check of the PLC tag.

**Log Files Summary**:

The program logs messages using the Python `logging` module. The log messages include timestamps, log levels (INFO, ERROR, etc.), and the log messages themselves. The log messages are stored in a separate log file named `my_log_file.log`. The log file is rotated daily, creating new log files with the date appended to the filename.

**Folder Structure**:

The project folder structure is as follows:

```
project_folder/
│
├── python_program.py
├── config.txt
├── logs/
│   └── my_log_file.log
└── csv_files/
    └── yyyy-mm-dd/
        └── data_yyyy-mm-dd.csv
```

- `python_program.py`: The Python script containing the main program logic.
- `config.txt`: The configuration file containing the IP address, tags, and sleep interval.
- `logs/`: The folder where log files are stored.
- `logs/my_log_file.log`: The log file where log messages are stored. A new log file is created daily with a date suffix.
- `csv_files/`: The folder where CSV files are stored, with sub-folders for each day.
- `csv_files/yyyy-mm-dd/`: Sub-folders for each day where CSV files are saved.
- `csv_files/yyyy-mm-dd/data_yyyy-mm-dd.csv`: CSV files containing data fetched from the PLC for each day.

**Prerequisites**:

To run the Python program successfully, the following prerequisites are required:

1. Python: Python 3.5 or higher should be installed on the system.
2. `pycomm3` Library: Install the `pycomm3` library using `pip install pycomm3`.
3. Ethernet Connectivity: Ensure an active Ethernet connection between the computer and the Allen-Bradley PLC.
4. Allen-Bradley PLC: Have access to an Allen-Bradley PLC with a compatible firmware version.
5. Configuring `config.txt`: Update the `config.txt` file with the correct IP address, tags, and sleep interval values.

**Troubleshooting**:

- If the program fails to run, check for errors in the log file (`my_log_file.log`) to understand the cause of the issue.
- Ensure the correct IP address and tags are specified in the `config.txt` file.
- Verify that the `pycomm3` library is installed correctly. If not, install it using `pip install pycomm3`.
- Check the Ethernet connectivity between the computer and the PLC to ensure communication is established.
- Confirm that the Allen-Bradley PLC is powered on and running with the correct firmware version.
- For PLC connection issues, ensure any firewall or security settings on the network do not block communication.
- If using the `pycomm3` library for the first time, check for updates and changes in the library's API or functionality.
- For additional troubleshooting, refer to the official `pycomm3` library documentation and the Allen-Bradley PLC's documentation and support resources.


program should work without RSLinx Classic Gateway when using the pycomm3 library. Unlike some other communication libraries, pycomm3 does not require RSLinx Classic Gateway for communication with Allen-Bradley PLCs over Ethernet/IP.

pycomm3 is built to communicate directly with Allen-Bradley Logix family controllers using Ethernet/IP without the need for additional middleware like RSLinx Classic Gateway. It handles the communication protocol and interactions directly, making it more lightweight and independent.

By using the pycomm3 library, your Python program communicates directly with the Allen-Bradley PLC over Ethernet, provided you have a valid IP address for the PLC and an active Ethernet connection. This eliminates the need to install and configure RSLinx Classic Gateway separately, simplifying the setup process and making the program more self-contained.

So, as long as you have met the prerequisites mentioned earlier (Python, pycomm3 library, Ethernet connectivity, and Allen-Bradley PLC with correct IP address and firmware version), your final program should work without requiring RSLinx Classic Gateway.
